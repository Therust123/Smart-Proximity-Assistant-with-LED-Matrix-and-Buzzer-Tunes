# Smart-Proximity-Assistant-with-LED-Matrix-and-Buzzer-Tunes
So this is project by which we can detect the obstacles distances by visual and audio effects.
This project works on the concept of ultrasonic sensor .
Whenever any ultrasonic wave is released from the sensor ,it travels with the speed of sound and after striking the very obstacle will come back ,we can measure the time taken by the sesnor to detect the incoming wave and then can divide it by 2 and then multiply by 
speed of sound in air that is approx 343 ms_1,to find the distance.
Now depending upon the distance we can make the different light combinations glow and also depending upon the distance we can generate buzzer sound of different frequncies and at different interval .
Fyi u will need HC595.
